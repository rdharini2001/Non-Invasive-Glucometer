# Particle Swarm-Optimized Artificial Neural Network for Non-Invasive Glucose Measurement and HbA1c Computation
In this work, a particle-swarm optimization-based artificial neural network for non-invasive continuous glucose monitoring using the principles of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is proposed. It is shown that the PSO-ANN approach outperforms the traditional backpropagation algorithm used in ANN training and several other regression algorithms with the lowest error metrics: ```MAE- 1.01```, ```MSE-2.16```, ```RMSE-0.97```, ```ùëÖ-squared-0.976``` and ```modified ùëÖ-squared-0.973```. The 3-stage methodology adopted in this work is shown below.

The accuracy and reliability of the proposed system are analysed using the Clarke Error Grid (CEG) with 93.9% of the obtained readings falling within zone A and 100% of the readings falling in the clinically accepted range (zones A and B). Refer to the [preprint](https://www.techrxiv.org/doi/full/10.36227/techrxiv.24465955.v1) for more details.
