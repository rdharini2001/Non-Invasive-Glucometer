# PARTICLE SWARM-OPTIMIZED ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK FOR NON-INVASIVE GLUCOSE MEASUREMENT AND HbA1c COMPUTATION
In this work, a particle-swarm optimization-based artificial neural network for non-invasive continuous glucose monitoring using the principles of NIRS is proposed. It is shown that the PSO-ANN approach outperforms the traditional backpropagation algorithm used in ANN training and several other regression algorithms with the lowest error metrics: MAE- 1.01, MSE-2.16, RMSE-0.97, ùëÖ2-0.976 and modified ùëÖ2-0.973. The 3-stage methodology adopted in this work is shown below.

The accuracy and reliability of the proposed system are analysed using the Clarke Error Grid (CEG) with 93.9% of the obtained readings falling within zone A and 100% of the readings falling in the clinically accepted range (zones A and B).
